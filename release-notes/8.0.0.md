### New Environment Keys Added


We added new environment keys to the DevOps repository ([PR link](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/pull/3991/files)) to as required for new features and functionality. For configuration and access to outside services or resources, these keys will be utilised.

Please note you don't need to deploy the DevOps repo. Once the PR is merged, deploy this service, env variable will automatically add from the DevOps branch.

In this release, we have introduced two new environment variables.

 OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_ON_OFF={{ownership_transfer_on_off | default("ON")}}OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_TOPIC={{ownership_transfer_topic_name | default("dev.transfer.ownership.job")}}
